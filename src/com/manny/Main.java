	// Challenge!
        /* Create a simple banking app. There should be a Bank class. It should have an ArrayList of branches.
        Each branch should have an ArrayList of Customers. The Customers should have an ArrayList of Doubles (transactions)
        Customer:
        Name, and ArrayList of doubles.
        Branch:
        Need to be able to add a new customer and initial transaction amount. Also needs to add additional transactions
        for that customer/branch.
        Bank:
        Add a new branch
        Add a customer to that branch with initial transaction
        Add a transaction for an existing customer for that branch
        Show a list of customers for a particular branch and optionally a list of their transactions.
        Demonstrate Autoboxing and Unboxing in your code.
        hint: Transactions
        Add data validation.
        e.g. check if it exists, or does not exist, etc.
        Think about where you are adding the code to perform certain actions.
